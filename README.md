## Newauth
This is our first attempt at authentication for Lane's learning purposes. We'll use this on several future projects, learn away and ask lots of questions.

## Notes from Lane

I've built this app to incorporate several features:

* There is a landing (home) page for everyone initially.  Once logged in as a user, each user has their own dashboard, and during their session this becomes their home page.  

* Users can login with a username and password, instead of with an email and password.

* Data is stored in a small MongoDB database.

* 'Forgot your password' links have been disabled until we can identify an email service and email address we'd like to use to send and receive instructions to reset user's passwords.  This feature has been added and tested, it just needs to be flipped on.
